# Melanoma Diagnostics App

## IP address hosted from AWS EC2 instance: *http://18.118.32.177:8080/*

# What is the Melanoma Diagnostics App?
AWS website that hosts cloud footage to record lightning strikes. The following project utilizes AWS free tier for an EC2 instance connected to an S3 bucket as well as an AWS RDS SQL database. The code below uses the Flask framework to combine HTML/CSS design with machine learning in Python to create a weather tracking application on the cloud.

## Inspiration
Hearing stories of students who struggle with getting volunteer hours and missing out on them.

## What it does
Stores footage of lightning strike data

## How we built it
- HTML/CSS: for frontend
- Python: for backend
- AWS: for cloud hosting
- SQL Alchemy

## Challenges we ran into
- Implementing AWS for the first time 
- Making a fully functional website
- Completing a full stack project within the given time frame
- Coming up with a feasible idea
- Building a database with SQLAlchemy

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Learning Flask
- Multistack application for making 
- Updating and learning multiple device connection

## What we learned
- How to implement Flask
- Updating user interface elements

## What's next for CloudWatch
- Having to add more features and allow more devices to cooperate with it
